# A Simple Game

DETAILS:

Have you ever played "Connect 4"? It's a popular kid's game by the Hasbro company. In this projrct,
our task is to create a Connect 4 game in python. Before the game get started, for reference you can also watch a video to get more information ->  https://youtu.be?utXzIFEVPjA

Once we got the rules down, our assignment should be fairly starightforward. We want to draw the board, and allow two players to take turns placing their pieces on the board (but as we learned above, they can onlu do so by choosing a column, not a row). The first player to get 4 acorss or diagonal should win!

Normally the pieces would be red and black, but you can use X and O instead.

EXTRA CREDIT:

Want to try colorful pieces instead of X and O? First you'll need to figure out how to import a package like termcolor into your own. Or you might be able to find unicode characters to use instead, depending on what your system supports. Here's hint: print(u'\u2B24').
